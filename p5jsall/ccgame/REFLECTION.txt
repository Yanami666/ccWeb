Ella  „ÄåRoom Escape„Äç
This room escape game was adapted by my dream. The character of the game, Yanami, is insomniac again, after having a hard time, she finally fell asleep. She then entered a room and she wants to escape but she's not really smart to get out by herself, so help her to get out of the room!
Reflection:
Making this game is both enjoyable but also painful. This game is adapted from my unity ui game, although the game is almost the same, the logic is completely different. Through this game, I fully felt the difference in the way things are handled in different programming languages. I think the hardest part of the game for me (in chronological order): at first it was making the gradient transition effect, and after a lot of searching, I finally figured out how to make it. Then it was the process of making the text in my game about the vase and box appearing when you click on them after the hammer and key only show up once to change back, at that point I felt like I was getting dizzy looking at all the text, and after a few days realized that the switch only needed to add the if condition of key/hammer clicked to make the text shown different. After this I encountered my biggest difficulty, which was entering the password and key clicked. After the class through your help I was able to solve it that day as well (thankkkk u ü•π).
Overall the assignment was very interesting, but because of my ability I felt that some of the things I wanted to do better were made more simple, for example the password was meant to be a sequence of clicking different numbered buttons.
