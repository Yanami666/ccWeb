A blue towel.When I was a kid, I needed a towel to sleep. It was a blue knitted towel with checkered pattern, and 5x7 inches big. However, I lost it in a hotel when I traveled to Macao. I think it was left on a white bed and maybe next to a pillow.; reflection on bottom!
Reflection: Because it is a blue towel,i first made the blue square.And to be more detailed then I made the squares to show it is a 5x7 inch size.At first I made the square color on by one. WHen I use the blendmode remove i can just remove all the white square then show up them by this way. I think the biggest challenge is that the towel is so simple so I need to make it not that simple...So I add a tag, just like how towel and clothes have normally. Because it is my first time doing p5js stuff, i didnt investigate many complicated codes, i just only used what I learned from the class. For next assignment I will try more on studying code other than the required ones.
