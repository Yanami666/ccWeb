For my experimental clock, I made the connection between plant growth and season change, which is the first sketch I drew. In spring and summer, the plant grows; in fall, the plant drain; in winter time freezes, and nothing changes. So with the observation of the change of plant, I can track of how time passed.
<1>I designed the four seasons first, and then I figured out the framerate I wanted. After that, I made a plant and used the if statement to make the choice of plant growing or drain or null.
<2>I designed the oven and the cupcake becomes bigger over time. By showing the change of cake and the upright corner timer to show the passing of time. (The reason I didn't choose this sketch is because it cost too much time to make up the scene...)
<3>I designed the park(I mean the tree) and its relationship with sunrise and sunset. I think of using shadows to show the passing of time. (I also didn't choose this one because it is a little bit hard to move the shadow smoothly, as well as the sun).
My overall reflection of this assignment is that i think this assignment is kinda fun for me. It is fun using the if statement(maybe is because I had already used it in Unity before this class, so I know some about it!!). I have learned more about using loop and boolean variables, which I think I am more familiar with it now. For this unconventional clock, there are many relationships between two variables that can be played with, I learned more about logic between two objects.
